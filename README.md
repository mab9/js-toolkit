Mab's js-toolkit is my personal JS tech toolkit that helps me mastering my JS skills. 

The toolkit addresses a wide range of JS issues such as objects, modules, functions, scripting and many more. 
In addition to that, the toolkit implements patterns like MVC and Move.

## Structure of the toolkit

- The src/topics folder addresses a wide range of JS issues. Open the index.html within a browser to run all topic tests and have an overview about their status.
- The src folder contains some fancy small apps like physic ball which works without physic formulas
- There are many tests addressing js topics which are supposed to show the characteristics of JS.
- The toolkit has been continuously developed. Accordingly, patterns are found again, 
  with which different versions of the toolkit are worn. For example the test framework. 
  
## My JS Errors

- **Find the break even**, when you change too much at once
  Make a plan and take a controlled approach. Leads to faster progress, more 
  consistency and much more enjoyment. The trick is to find the break-even point, 
  when it makes sense to change (rewrite) everything or go step by step or even don't provide some improvments.
  This only works when you have an overview and control over your changes.
    
- **Mastering Moves** don't go to detailed, you will never be finished/satisfied with your work. 
  Make a plan and take a controlled approach of your goal. Note down where you are and where you want to go.
  This will help you to keep getting forward, even when you are not satisfied and have, ugly code. 
  
## Important knowledge

- Check the errors that your dependencies bring with them! What number of errors do they bring with them, do I need that?
- If it's about security -> use hardened browsers that only run the exact application and are otherwise unusable!
- Do not use this, class, new, instanceOf for JS!
